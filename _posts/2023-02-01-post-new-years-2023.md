So 2022 went by pretty quickly. I guess I'm just going to do a recap of my 2022. Basically I moved to Seattle! Which I had always wanted to do since I was a kid and visited for the first time. I really like Seattle and I don't understand why, the weather is so gloomy and depressive 9 months out of the year and I'm originally/grew up in SoCal which is literally mediterrean weather like *chef's kiss* perfection, SUN. But like what's that saying again? OPPOSITES ATTRACT! Yeah I guess. I really enjoy the summers though. Seattle summers are maybe even better than Cali summers (haha). I don't know why I laughed. I will continue to laugh and nothing can stop me. I AM A FORCE OF NATURE. 

Anyway so like I also moved into my first studio apartment and that was a doozy of an experience. Adulting (i hate this phrase) is so weird. Maybe I just chose to do adulting in the worst way and most awkward way possible and made it like much harder than it should've for myself but like the pandemic was hard in general especially for mental health, and I know I should appreciate and be grateful for the things I've learned this year. But I definitely think I went to my darkest places during the pandemic, while living in a single in Seattle for the first time during the winter right after like a break-up. It's the perfect situation if you WANT depression. Anyway I'm much better now so it's all behind me and it's only gotten better since thank god. I'm doing a long distance relationship with my parents right now which is mid but I don't think I could live where they live without losing my mind from boredom? I already lived with them for two years to save money and also since my plans fell through/I was just worried about catching COVID and didn't want to travel and I felt like I didn't really have any new experiences or grow as a person and it was kind of sad. So last October when I moved to Seattle I guess that was like me trying to take more control and be in charge of my life and like do things that I wanted to.

I didn't make the video game that I wanted to last year unfortunately but I will try to be better this year. My friend Brian really loves the Atomic Habits book and since I read it I'm like ok seems legit. I mean self help books are kinda common sense and sometimes definitely feel like a waste of money but it's nice to have some kind of coaching, especially if you're like early-twenties/almost mid-twenties feelin' kinda lost but vibing like I am. OH I am so cringe.
