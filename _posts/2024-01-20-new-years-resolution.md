I feel like 2023 has passed by so quickly! Since it's still January I was thinking it would be a good idea to blog my new year's resolutions, and then maybe embarassingly review them when the next year rolls by so I can see if I've made some progress or there's areas of my life I kinda wish went differently, and there's some improvements to make or lessons to learn for the future.

When I try to think about the highlights of the last year, what I'm proud about is I really worked on my mental health, maybe not actively but it's just improved so much passively throughout the year and it's such a difference from the isolation of the pandemic and the stresses of entering the workforce. In hindsight, even in college and high school I had a hard time, or especially a hard time sometimes feeling like I belonged or feeling like I was good enough or worthy enough. It's also so hard because I feel like at that age you're super worried about and trying to figure out your future too and you just don't really know much. Also when you have low self-esteem you kinda just let people treat you in ways that are unacceptable, stressful, and make excuses for others. The older I get the more I realize how important mental health is and the more I appreciate when people are decent and mature.

Having support from and seeing family and friends is something that's so important and I'm grateful for. I'm always nostalgic about how easy it was to hang out during college, when everyone lived so close together and there were so many events and cool things to do, but I really appreciate being able to spend more time with family. I really feel like I get a huge peace of mind whenever I'm around people I know well.

I guess things I want to work on for the year-well I probably want to journal more and write more (something I'm working on right now), and keep learning and reading even if I'm not required or in school anymore necessarily. Maybe I could write some reviews for games or tv shows or movies again? I'm not sure. I love game journalism and reading reviews more than I love playing games sometimes. Anyway, I also wanna stay focused on my goals and be more accountable to myself. I also want to be more financially saavy and learn how to cook eventually but I feel like I say that every year. It's an old story I keep telling myself but hopefully this year I can finish and publish my first game! Even if it's not that great.

I signed up for my first 5k! I'm really excited 'cause I've never done a race before and it's nice to have some event to work for.

What's surprising to me this year is I started to love weight training! I'm no professional or even really any good, but I started watching Caroline Girvan's Iron Series and it's super accessable so far because her videos are short (only 30 minutes), super effective (she's so knowledgable), can be done at home + I don't want to go to the gym cause it's more time driving or either just kinda intimidating, and the equipment is just dumbbells. I really don't feel confident nor strong enough to handle barbells and they're also more expensive-I feel like this has been a really accessible way for me to start working on strength gains.

Also last minute thought but it's weird how different I feel like I've changed as a person since 2023. I don't know if I just feel that way superficially but hopefully it's been good changes and I'll keep getting better at taking care of things or smarter and wiser.
