Hi! This is going to be the first dev blog post for this video game I'm working on! 

So this is basically a game I've always wanted to make since I was in college, and it's about the good and bad parts of going through our university system. Hopefully it turns out well, but I think it's going to be a fun and hopefully not too frustrating of a creative project! 

I've always dreamt about making my own games.

First thing I've been working on is really getting used to using Unity as a tool to create the game and just learning about the unity editor and how all the assets for the project are supposed to be organized. I think my approach is I'm just going to build and then scrap it all and then re-do it but better with all the mistakes I've learned from the first time so that it just turns out better hopefully the second time around. I also think it's a perfectionistic tendency to want it to be perfect the first time too much that you never really start or either make too many excuses to start-that's what I'm trying to avoid most. 

I already watched a couple of unity tutorial videos from Brackeys (he's a really good teacher, also-is this another form of procrastination?) but I think actually building my own is going to teach me more when I'm not relying on someone else to kind of give me a blueprint on what to make.

That being said I made a really rudimentary grid and tile management script because my first goal is to get the base building aspect of the game down and to have it be interactable with the mouse. Like I'm not going to think about art like as long as the sprites convey enough for the player to know what they are it's good enough for me. Right now I just want it to work. 

So I guess that's just a technical rundown of what I've been thinking about lately. I've just ignored art outside of like saving inspirational pieces in a folder to look back later.

From a design and player experience perspective... I'm not really in love with the current ideas I have. I don't think the loops in the game are interesting enough nor do they build upon themselves in a satisfying way. I think the issue with base-building games is that they're too slow or not really interactive nor engaging enough in my opinion. Versus games that are more first person shooters where there's like instant moments where you have to react or you'll die are more exhilarating, it's not as fun if you feel like the game could play itself without you sometimes unless that's what you're going for. Right now I think the game as just a base-builder would be too sleepy. I thought about trying to mash it up with some other genre for a sparkly novel concept and whatever but like maybe-cards. I feel like that's already done. I guess at some point lots of things have already been done and I should just pick something I think would be fun and tweak once I have something down.

I want it to be like a base-builder but also a top down character rpg, with maybe a real time battle system. There has to be an interesting combo system that doesn't feel too artifical, and I was also thinking about adding a personality system to the game and having each character's ai dependent on their personality.

The issue with the university system in this game is that after a certain point in time, students graduate. I don't know maybe it'll be a good thing having to constantly train and use new units but I also think it'll cause the player to be less attached and maybe interested in the characters they do have if they have to give them up at a certain time. I guess I could have graduated students take permanent positions at the university too. I also don't know if it's motivating enough for the player to have their goal be to support their students launching their lives and careers the best way they want to, feeling like they left the university more capable and knowledgable and ready to take on the world after?

Or maybe the university could be less of a university system but more of a community with a school and people in the community just occasionally go to the school and take classes and pick up skills. So then I guess I could pivot to more of a town sim than a school sim. Maybe I should just dig into the annoying-ness of having to restart with new characters every new year, not sure-and have the player try to figure their own way around it. 

I also think it's interesting or will be interesting seeing how the player decides to and where they decide to place like dorms or important lecture halls and what kind of transit system they will put in place or bus lines. They need to be able to make bus lines imo. And there needs to be grocery stores and restaurants and bad cafeteria food.

Watch me think about this a ton and then make something that's especially boring to play LOL.
