Hi! This is going to be the first dev blog post for this video game I'm working on! So this is basically a game I've always wanted to make since I was in college, and it's about the good and bad parts of going through our university system atm and just kind of that whole experience. Hopefully it turns out well but I think it's going to be a fun and hopefully not too frustring creative project! I've always dreamed about making my own games and I hope this is year I can finally make those dreams come true. 

So the first thing I've been working on is really getting used to using Unity as a tool to create the game and just learning about the unity editor and how all the assets for the project are supposed to be organized. I think my approach is I'm just going to build and then scrap it all and then re-do it but better with all the mistakes I've learned from the first time so that it just turns out better hopefully the second time around. I also think it's a perfectionistic tendency to want it to be perfect the first time too much that you never really start or either make too many excuses to start and I think that's what I'm trying to avoid most. 

I already watched a couple of unity tutorial videos from Brackeys (he's a really good teacher, also-is this another form of procrastiantion LOL jk) but I think actually building my own is going to teach me more when I'm not relying on someone else to kind of give me a blueprint on what to make. That being said I made a really rudimentary grid and tile management script because my first goal is to get the base building aspect of the game down and to have it be interactable with the mouse. Like I'm not going to think about art like as long as the sprites convey enough for the player to know what they are it's good enough for me. Right now I just want it to work. 

So I guess that's just a technical rundown of what I've been thinking about lately. I've just ignored art outside of like saving inspirational pieces in a folder to look back later but like actually getting art, I'm not sure what I'll do. 

From a design and player experience perspective... I'm not really in love with the current ideas I have. I don't think the loops in the game are interesting enough nor do they build upon themselves in a satisfying way. I think the issue with base-building games is that they're too slow or not really interactive nor engaging enough in my opinion. Versus games that are more first person shooters where there's like instant moments where you have to react or you'll die are more exhilarating, it's not as fun if you feel like the game could play itself without you sometimes unless that's what you're going for. Right now I think the game as just a base-builder would be too sleepy. I thought about trying to mash it up with some other genre for a sparkly novel concept and whatever but like maybe-cards. I feel like that's already done. I guess at some point lots of things have already been done and I should just pick something I think would be fun. 

I want it to be like a base-builder but also a top down character rpg. But there also has to be like some interesting kind of combat system. I don't know it sounds like a bajillon other games out there.
