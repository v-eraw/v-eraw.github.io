I started listening to audiobooks while I run and before I go to sleep at night. I think it's like harder for me to focus on the book though if it's not a visual for me, but I think it's also a better alternative for entertainment right before I sleep cause I don't have to look at any electronics. I'm not really sure how much if it is really being absorbed by my brain though. But yeah, also I'm open to suggestions for new books I just don't know when I'll get to finish them or if I'll remember reading them that well. I like books a lot though.

I think ever since I moved to Seattle I've been having fun but being an adult and living away from your parents for the first time in a long time is kinda hard. It's nice we have phones and videos to catch up with but probably being in person is best.
