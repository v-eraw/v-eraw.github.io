I started listening to audiobooks while I run and before I go to sleep at night. I think it's like harder for me to focus on the book though, but I think it's also a better alternative for entertainment right before I sleep cause I don't have to look at any electronics. I'm not really sure how much if any I'm really paying attention to though... But yeah, also I'm open to suggestions for new books I just don't know when I'll get to finish them or if I'll remember reading them that well. I like books a lot though.

I think ever since I moved to Seattle I've been having fun but being an adult and living away from your parents for the first time in a long time is kinda hard. It's nice we have phones and videos to catch up with but probably being in person is best.

I've also started drinking more coffee since moving to Seattle which is kind of funny. I've never really been a coffee person until now. I actually started drinking two cups a day instead of one and feeling like it wasn't enough so I think I'll have to wean myself off and start drinking only tea or just decaf.
